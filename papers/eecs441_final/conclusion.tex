\section{Conclusion}

Preliminary tests show that Tecellate is suitable as a wireless network testing platform and is reasonably scalable. Almost all of the originally specified functionality was implemented. The missing pieces are the simplest due to the authors' hardest-problem-first implementation strategy. With further work on the accuracy of the simulation, the system's unique approach to scalability could make it very competitive in the network simulator ecosystem.
