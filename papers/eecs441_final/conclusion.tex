\section{Conclusion}

This project has three layers. At the top layer, we want to refine a system that distributes work among several servers. At the middle layer, we want to implement a simulation. At the bottom layer, we want to use it as a testbed for ad-hoc wireless networks. For these reasons, we think it is a compelling course project.
