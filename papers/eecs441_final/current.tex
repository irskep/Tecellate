\section{Current State of the Project}

The simulation contains \textbf{agents} which must be sent stimuli to respond to. The current implementation consists of a \textbf{master process} which connects to several \textbf{coordinator processes} that are responsible for keeping the state of disjoint sets of agent processes.

The master process is responsible for connecting to the coordinators, sending them configurations, and waiting for their final responses. The coordinator connects to neighbor coordinators and agents, serves requests for information about the state of its agents in the last turn, and processes its own agents by requesting information from its neighbors and from its agents. In this way, the coordinators operate in lock-step, turn by turn, until all turns have been processed by all coordinators.

The current version of the simulation only supports agent movement and agent death. Agents are killed when they both occupy the same cell. The master process and coordinators do not attempt to balance load after the simulation has begun.
